# Leadership Logic

This folder holds the **product and backend logic** for:

1. **Freelancer Leadership Board** (metrics, ratings, quality of work)
2. **Client-side freelancer search** (by role/skills, top 10)
3. **Freelancer dashboard popup** (what clients see when they click a freelancer)

**Full logic:** see [LOGIC.md](./LOGIC.md).

Frontend is ready; backend can implement APIs and data as described in LOGIC.md.
